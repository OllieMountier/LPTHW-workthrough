#Exercise 1- A good first program
# Teaches about how to run a program. Fundamental work, I am only doing in order for full completion of the book.

print("Hello World")
print("Hello again")
print("I like typing this")
print("This is fun")
print("Yay! printing")
print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
print("'I said' do not touch this")

#You are then tasked to run this file, a new line I will print below, and then just one of the lines
#You are then told to put a "#" in front of one of the lines to see what happens. Obviously, I am already 
#using comments so have not bothered.

print("printing another line")
