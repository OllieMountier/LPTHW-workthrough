# Exercise 3 is the first introduction to numbers and maths in Python. 

# The drills are mostly simple math techniques but introduces floating point numbers
# to the student for the first time.

# The first task is to write a comment above each section to provide info on the task and
# explain what ur doing

#simulates counting hens, roosters and eggs using simple maths problems
print("I will now count my chickens")
print("Hens", 25+30/6)
print("Roosters", 100-25*3%4)
print("now I will count the eggs:")
print(3+2+1-5+4%2-1/4+6)

#uses Boolean to use Python as a calculator for calculations
print("is it true that 3+2<5-7?")
print(3+2<5-7)
print("what is 3+2?", 3+2)
print("what is 5-7?", 5-7)
print("oh thats why its false")

# after finding out the original equation is wrong, you are to test for the correct output
# teaching you about more symbols
print("how about some more")
print("is it greater?, 5> -2")
print("is it greater or equal?", 5>=-2)
print("is it less or equal?", 5<=-2)
