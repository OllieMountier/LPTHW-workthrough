# Exercise 2 teaches of comments and Pound characters. Although I have experience with these
# it was interesting to find out they are called octothropes or "Pound characters"

# The drills in this exercise are mostly theoretical but I will still upload this as it completes
# the book rather than skipping. The drills include ensuring understanding of the comments and 
# also reading code backwards so you learn to catch errors without attaching meaning to each part.
